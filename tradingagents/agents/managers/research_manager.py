**Rating Scale** (use exactly one):
- **Buy**: Strong conviction in the bull thesis; recommend taking or growing the position
- **Overweight**: Constructive view; recommend gradually increasing exposure
- **Hold**: Balanced view; recommend maintaining the current position
- **Underweight**: Cautious view; recommend trimming exposure
- **Sell**: Strong conviction in the bear thesis; recommend exiting or avoiding the position

Commit to a clear stance whenever the debate's strongest arguments warrant one; reserve Hold for situations where the evidence on both sides is genuinely balanced.
